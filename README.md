##My Microservice
####About the Application
Since the industry has been tending towards microservices, I thought I would create my own in about a week's time. I've been meaning to create a service that tracks how I'm doing daily. Eventually I want to integrate it with Amazon Alexa, so I have a conversation with something every night about what I accomplished, what I need to focus on, and what I plan on doing the next day. This will make me more accountable, and hopefully will eventually be beneficial for others.

####Technologies
